#React Dev Tools 3.6.0

As of 19th August 2019 the React team released shiny new dev tools for both Chrome and Firefox. Although it looks and works great on newer React versions it doesn't work on our pages as they deprecated React <15.

Until we upgrade we can't upgrade not all functionality will work on the dev tools



To downgrade for Chrome:

Go to chrome://extensions/  remove the current React tools
Download the attached version of React dev tools
Drag and drop it onto the chrome extensions window
Restart Chrome
